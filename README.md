MMC6278 Assignment 2

I had no major issues while completing this assignment. A few minor things:
     - For some reason, my images wouldn't center on mobile view and I couldn't figure out why. 
     - Stacking the gallery images was also a challenge. I'd be interested to see what other solutions are out there for images of different lengths. It was hard to find something that looked good on all devices so I prioritized desktop and mobile.

No outside resources were used other than what was linked in the instructions.
