MMC6278 Assignment 2

I had no major issues while completing this assignment. A few minor things:
     - For some reason, my images wouldn't center on mobile view and I couldn't figure out why. 
          - I realized why this wasn't working. I didn't specify a column width for the small breakpoint and so the "justify-content" class didn't work.

     - Stacking the gallery images was also a challenge. I'd be interested to see what other solutions are out there for images of different lengths. It was hard to find something that looked good on all devices so I prioritized desktop and mobile. I think maybe changing the order the pictures were in depending on the breakpoint could have helped.

No outside resources were used other than what was linked in the instructions.
